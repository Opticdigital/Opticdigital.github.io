I believe that the end of Tartaria began in 1680 when Krakatoa erupted. There&#39;s a theory that Sitchin missed a decimal point on the orbit of Planet X, Nibiru, and that it&#39;s 360 years instead of 3600. The Thera eruption has been tree ring dated to 1560 B.C. If it was caused by Nibiru, the 360 year orbit would put it in our solar system in 1680. It&#39;s due back in 2040 and we&#39;re already having unprecedented earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. I find the earthquake liquefaction theory more plausible than the mud flood theory however there is a mud volcano in Java, near Krakatoa, that&#39;s been erupting since 2005 and the eruption is being blamed on drilling for natural gas.  The Tartarians were probably descendents of Atlantis and existed worldwide for thousands of years. There were probably huge earthquakes also around 1680 and once Tartaria was in decline they undoubtedly fell prey to numerous opportunists such as the Russians,Chinese, Khazars, etc. The Khazars had already moved into Europe as the AskeNAZI jews and have developed into the CaBa&#39;al that is currently attempting another great reset
