Tartarus was the very well documented Mongol Empire founded by Genghis Khan in the early 1200s.<br />It finally disappeared in the 1600s. (For a variety of reasons)<br /><br />A Greek word for hell is Tartarus. To Christians in the middle ages the Mongols seemed to be from hell. Hence the name.<br /><br />The Great Wall of China was completed about 1625. That&#39;s why it begins to appear on maps around 1600.
