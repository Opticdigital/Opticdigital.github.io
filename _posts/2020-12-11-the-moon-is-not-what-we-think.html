Now we've all seen the moon, its been around for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years. That's right hundreds or thousands, not billions or millions. Like everything on this website you'll have to go into this with an open mind leaving everything you thought you knew behind. There is a list of philosophers and early writers such as Democritus, Anaxagoras, Plutarch, Aristotle, Aristochius, Hesychius, Dionysius Chalcidensis, Lucian, Hippolytus, Apollonius of Rhodes, Empedocles, Censorinus among others who claim there was a time where people lived before the moon.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It is said that the Arcadians (of the Peloponnese in Greece) are autochtonous people who have seen the "birth" of the moon. They have tales of life before the emergence of earth's moon. For this reason they have been known as proselenial. Aristotle wrote that Arcadia in Greece, before being inhabited by the Hellenes, had a population of Pelasgians, and that these aborigines occupied the land already before there was a moon in the sky above the Earth. You can also find evidence of a time before the moon in Columbia with oral traditions of such Indians as those of the Bogota highlands in the eastern Cordilleras of Columbia, tribesmen of Chibchas are quoted as saying, “In the earliest times, when the moon was not yet in the heavens.” For more modern look at the moon you can find a Youtube channel by the name of <i>crrow777 </i>and he has multiple videos of a <b>"lunar wave"</b>. It's hard to describe the lunar wave in writing so I will post a link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3axPn65MGM" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Some allusions to the time before there was a Moon may be found also in the Scriptures. In Job 25:5 the grandeur of the Lord who “Makes peace in the heights” is praised and the time is mentioned “before [there was] a moon and it did not shine.” Also in Psalm 72:5 it is said: “Thou wast feared since [the time of] the sun and before [the time of] the moon, a generation of generations.”</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;There are also claims the moon is some kind of base like the Death Star in Star Wars. Nasa even claims when the moon is struck by meteors it "rings like a bell" maybe indicating that the moon is hollow. Other theories are the moon that we see here on Earth could be nothing more than a hologram used to cover "something" up.So what is the moon and how did it get where it is?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We here at Colliercast would love to hear your feedback whether it be comments or even your theories on the matter.
